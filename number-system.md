# Number System

## Decimal System

The decimal system is composed of 10 numerals or symbols. These 10 symbols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; using these symbols as digits of a number, we can express any quantity. The decimal system, also called the base-10 system because it has 10 digits, has evolved naturally as a result of the fact that people have 10 fingers. In fact, the word digit is derived from the Latin word for "finger".

The decimal system is a positional-value system in which the value of a digit depends on its position.

## Binary System

In the binary system there are only two symbols or possible digit values, 0 and 1. Even so, this base-2 system can be used to represent any quantity that can be represented in decimal or other number systems. In general though, it will take a greater number of binary digits to express a given quantity. It is very easy to design simple, accurate electronic circuits that operate with only two voltage levels. For this reason, almost every digital system uses the binary number system as the basic number system of its operations.

There are numerous devices that have only two operating states or can be operated in two extreme conditions. Among these are: light bulb (bright or dark), diode (conducting or nonconducting), electromagnet (energized or de-energized), transistor (cut off or saturated), photocell (illuminated or dark), thermostat (open or closed), mechanical clutch (engaged or disengaged), and spot on a magnetic disk (magnetized or demagnetized)

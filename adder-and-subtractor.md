# Adder & Subtractor

## Half Adder

A half adder is a combinational circuit that performs the addition of two bits and produces a sum bit and a carry bit. It has two inputs: A and B, which add two input digits, and two outputs: S and C, which are the sum and carry out. 


## Full Adder

A full adder is a combinational circuit that performs the addition of three bits (two significant bits and a previous carry) and produces a sum bit and a carry bit. It has three inputs: A, B and C<sub>in</sub>, which add three input digits, and two outputs: S and C<sub>out</sub>, which are the sum and carry out.
